# The Code Search Engine

## 👋 Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to my Code Search Engine project. This is a simple yet functional search interface I built about a year ago using plain HTML and CSS. It's one of my earlier projects where I focused on creating a clean, Google-inspired search interface to practice my fundamental web development skills.

## 🎯 Project Background
I created this project as part of my journey to strengthen my portfolio and sharpen my web development skills. While it's been a while since I've coded in plain HTML/CSS, this project represents an important stepping stone in my learning journey.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🌟 Features
- Clean, minimalist search interface
- Google-inspired design
- Responsive layout
- Simple and intuitive user experience

## 🚀 What's Next
I'm currently embarking on an exciting journey of creating 30+ daily projects to further enhance my skills. These upcoming projects will:
- Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- Progress towards more complex implementations
- Eventually lead into React and NextJS development

## ⚠️ Maintenance Notice
Please note that this project, along with my other initial projects, won't be actively maintained as they serve as learning milestones rather than production applications. However, feel free to:
- Fork the project
- Use it as inspiration
- Learn from the code
- Suggest improvements through issues

## 🤝 Contributing
While I won't be maintaining this project actively, you're welcome to fork it and make it your own! If you create something cool with it, I'd love to see what you build.
